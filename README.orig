Installation Notes:

UNIX:
To install just copy file subconv.py somewhere in your PATH. Then set correct 
access permissions for this file:

something. like: chmod 755 subconv.py should be OK :)

WINDOWS:
Copy file subconv.py somewhere and use it with "python.exe subconv.py ...". 
You probably want a batch written doing this or whatever.

Usage Notes:

You get help using -h switch. There is some info.

By default program runs as a filter reading from stdin and writing to stdout.
If you want to import subtitles to a spreadsheet program like Excel or 
OpenOffice Calc, you can use csv output.
